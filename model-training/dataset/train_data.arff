get, ' This method is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Shopping, and Finding and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot; and what the item ID represents. This method lets you use the legacy item ids retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API methods. For more information about how to use legacy ids with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item ids of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. For more information, see fieldgroups.

You use this method to show the item details of items with multiple aspects, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. This method returns two main containers; items and commonDescriptions. The items container has an array of containers with the details of each item in the group. The commonDescriptions container has an array of containers for a description and the item ids of all the items that have this exact description.

The Buy APIs are designed to let you create an eBay shopping experience in your app or website. This means you will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response.

However, this method does return items where both FIXED_PRICE and AUCTION are available as a buying option. After a bid has been placed, items become active auction items and are no longer returned by default, but they remain accessible by filtering for the AUCTION buying option.

It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API methods. For more information about how to use legacy ids with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item ids of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. For more information, see fieldgroups.

Starting in January 2019, eBay will begin to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers. This feature is rolling out on specific dates to specific US states as defined on the following page: eBay sales tax collection. Once eBay starts to collect sales tax for a state, no action is required on the seller's part and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax. The sales-tax collection process will apply to all the sales in the states that support this feature, whether the seller is located in or outside of the United States. When a buyer purchases an item on eBay, and the ship-to address is one of the states where eBay collects the sales tax, eBay will calculate and add the applicable sales tax at checkout. The buyer will pay both the cost of the item along with the sales tax. eBay will collect and remit the tax.'
