# RESTRuler

The RESTRuler CLI is a tool that can evaluate RESTful APIs on the basis of design rule violations. These violations are based on the design rules from Mark Mass√©'s book [REST API Design Rulebook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rest-api-design/9781449317904/).
Currently, RESTRuler can parse the following Web API description languages:

* [OpenAPI v2](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/)
* [OpenAPI v3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)

RESTRuler has been developed in the [Empirical Software Engineering Group](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/ese) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, as a research prototype written in Java.
It is a command-line tool that takes the path or URL to an OpenAPI definition file as input and displays a list of design rule violations as output.
Optionally, a Markdown report file can be generated with additional details and improvement suggestions.

## Design Rules

Descriptions of the implemented design rules can be found in our [rule documentation](./docs/rules/README.md).

## Project Architecture

A detailed description of the project and implemented components can be found in the [architecture documentation](./docs/architecture.md).

## General Usage Instructions

For a quick start, you can simply download `rest-ruler.jar` for a certain [release](https://github.com/restful-ma/rest-ruler/releases).
Then execute these commands in the same folder as the JAR file:

```bash
# execute JAR file to display CLI parameters
java -jar rest-ruler.jar -h

# run with an example API from https://apis.guru
java -jar rest-ruler.jar -p https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/circleci.com/v1/openapi.yaml
```

If you want to download or clone the full repository, run these commands in the root folder of the repository to build and start the tool:

```bash
cd cli
# create JAR file
./gradlew assemble
# execute JAR file to display CLI parameters
java -jar build/libs/rest-ruler.jar -h
# run tests
./gradlew test
# test coverage (output: ./build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html)
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# run with an example API from https://apis.guru
java -jar build/libs/rest-ruler.jar -p https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/circleci.com/v1/openapi.yaml
```

This produces the following output:

```cli
java -jar build/libs/rest-ruler.jar -p https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/circleci.com/v1/openapi.yaml

-----------------INFO ANALYSIS----------------
-----------------------------------------------

Besides the static analysis there is the dynamic analysis for which the credentials for the openapi definition need to be provided. These are not stored unless you allow it. No changes will be made to resources nor are they saved. 
If you want to do the dynamic analysis, enter yes or y, if you do not want to do it, enter any other key.
[yes/no]
n
----------------------------------------------

Begin with the analysis of the file from: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/circleci.com/v1/openapi.yaml
